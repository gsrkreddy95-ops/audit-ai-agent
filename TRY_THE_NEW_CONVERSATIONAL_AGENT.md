## 🎯 **What's Different:**

### **Old Way (Robotic):**
```
> What can you do?
Evidence collection. Screenshot capture. Data export.

> Take screenshot
ERROR: Missing parameters.

> help
Commands: screenshot [params], export [params], review [params]
```

### **New Way (Natural):**
```
> What can you do?
Great question! I'm your intelligent audit evidence collection 
assistant, and I can help you in several powerful ways:

First, I can collect audit evidence from various sources...
[Full explanation with context]

> Take screenshot
I'd be happy to help with that! To take the screenshot, I'll 
need a few details from you:
1. Which RDS cluster?
2. Which AWS account?
3. Which region?

If you're not sure about the cluster name, I can list all RDS 
clusters in your account first - just let me know!
